# Gratitude App Debug Exercise

## Directions:
Find and fix all of the bugs (hint: there are 13 bugs!) to get rid of the errors and get the app up and running.

### NONE OF THE BUGS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL MODULES TO BE INSTALLED!

To run the application in the browser, first run `npm install` then run `npm start` in your terminal.

*BONUS* Once app is functional, add styling so that it matches the wireframe pixel for pixel!

Finished app should look like:
